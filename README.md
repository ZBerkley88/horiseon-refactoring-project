# Bootcamp Challenge No. 1 

## Description

The purpose of this exercise was to refactor existing code for the Horiseon homepage. The existing index.html lacked <alt> text for the <img> tags. The existing style.css was lengthy and could benefit from consolidating certain selector properties and restructuring the order of the code.

The motivation for this project was to create a neater, more readable code for other developers, as well as to update the code with alt text for visually-impaired users. 

There were I few problems I wanted to solve during the course of this project. I found myself spending the most time ensuring that the style.css was organized and easy to read. 

While working on this project, I learned the difference between the <title> and <alt> tags. Because the background image under the .hero class selector was in not in the index.html, I did not think the <div> would take an <alt> tag. After a bit of Googling, I believed <title> to accomplish a similar function as <alt>, but later learned that <title> does not necessarily always work with screen readers. I ended up including the <alt> tag in the <div> containing the background image.
