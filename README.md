# Bootcamp Challenge No. 1 

## Description

The purpose of this exercise was to refactor existing code for the Horiseon website homepage. The existing index.html lacked <alt> text for the <img> tags and contained many <div> containers. The existing style.css was lengthy and could benefit from some consolidation and restructuring. 

The motivation for this project was to create a neater, more readable code for other developers, as well as to update the code with alt text for visually-impaired users. 

While working on this project, I learned the difference between the <title> and <alt> tags. I did not think a non-<img> tag would take an <alt> tag. After a bit of Googling, I believed <title> to accomplish a similar function as <alt>, but later learned that <title> does not necessarily always work with screen readers.  

I also learned a lot about semantic tags. It was not until I collaborated with Adrian Carter that I realized exactly how many <div> tags were in the index.html code. We applied more relevant tags to the entire code, including tags we had not heard of before like <aside> and <figure>.

The overall result is a much more organized code with more specificity and overall organization. I toyed with the idea of adding a media query to the CSS, but I was not pleased with the end result.
